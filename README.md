# ☀️ Solar Photovoltaic User Detection & ⚡ Power Outage Analysis


## 🚩 Overview

The integration of renewable energy sources into modern power grids has brought about new challenges, especially in distinguishing solar photovoltaic (PV) users from non-PV users in large-scale datasets. Traditional methods often rely heavily on expensive satellite imagery or detailed on-site information from solar panels. However, these solutions are not feasible when scaling to datasets encompassing tens of thousands of users.

Additionally, real-world smart meter data presents various challenges, such as **data transmission errors**, **abnormal electricity behaviors** (e.g., electricity theft or leakage), and the **detection of power outages**. These factors complicate the accurate analysis of energy usage patterns.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project can be divided into two parts to address these challenges:

- **Amplify** the distinction between non-PV and PV users based on net load profiles and achieve effective clustering.
- **Improve** anomaly detection algorithms for large-scale datasets to efficiently identify power outages and abnormal events in smart meter data following the integration of renewable energy sources.


## 💡 Features

- ☀️ **Scalable PV User Detection**: Differentiates between solar and non-solar households without satellite data.
- ⚡ **Outage Detection**: Identifies power outages amidst noise and anomalies in smart meter readings.
- 🌎 **Real-World Data Application**: Applies advanced analytics on an extensive dataset with over **160,000 consumers in Southern California** recorded at **1-hour intervals**, ensuring its application in our real life.
